    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "Over the last couple of years, the world has undergone a lot of changes. The beginning and ending of the global pandemic caused tremendous impact on the public transport system and on travel behaviour in general. Furthermore, shifts in technology and societal habits have influenced why and how people move from A to B. To better understand these changes, this study examines the long-term trends in travel patterns, modal preferences, and mobility choices in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report researches how the use of different modes of transport have changed over time and if this varies in the different provinces of the Netherlands and the travel purposes. By analyzing data from the Centraal Bureau voor Statistiek, which provides detailed statistics on trips, distances, and travel times, we aim to identify the underlying factors driving these trends. The findings will offer insights into the trends of mobility use in the Netherlands, helping to inform future transport planning and policy decisions.\n"

    "# 2. Analysis about mobility modes\n",
    "In the Netherlands, the bicycle remains the most dominant mode of transport in the long term, exhibiting only minor fluctuations over the observed period. This stability reflects the country’s deeply embedded cycling culture, supported by extensive infrastructure and favourable policies. \n",
    "The use of the car showed a slight decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily as a consequence of the widespread shift to working from home. Since 2022, however, car use has gradually increased again. Overall, car dependency remains structurally stable, indicating that the private car continues to play a central role in Dutch mobility patterns despite sustainability concerns.\n",
    "The train experienced a substantial reduction in ridership during the pandemic due to the rise in remote working practices. This behavioural change appears to be structural rather than temporary. Although train use has shown signs of recovery since 2022, levels have not yet returned to those recorded before 2019. The associated loss in fare revenue and service challenges illustrate the long-term impact of changing work patterns on public transport demand.\n",
    "Similarly, bus, tram, and metro modes experienced a significant decline in passenger numbers during the pandemic. Recovery has been gradual, and usage levels remain below those of 2019. This trend suggests a broader shift away from collective modes of transport, particularly for commuting purposes.\n",
    "The share of walking increased during the pandemic, likely as a substitute for other travel modes and as a leisure activity. After 2021, walking levels decreased slightly but remained higher than before the pandemic, suggesting a modest, lasting behavioural change.\n",
    "In conclusion, the bicycle and the car continue to constitute the structurally dominant modes of transport in the Netherlands, while public transport modes, especially rail and urban transit, are still in a phase of gradual recovery from the pandemic’s long-term effects.\n"

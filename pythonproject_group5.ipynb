    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "Over the last couple of years, the world has undergone a lot of changes. The beginning and ending of the global pandemic caused tremendous impact on the public transport system and on travel behaviour in general. Furthermore, shifts in technology and societal habits have influenced why and how people move from A to B. To better understand these changes, this study examines the long-term trends in travel patterns, modal preferences, and mobility choices in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report researches how the use of different modes of transport have changed over time and if this varies in the different provinces of the Netherlands and the travel purposes. By analyzing data from the Centraal Bureau voor Statistiek, which provides detailed statistics on trips, distances, and travel times, we aim to identify the underlying factors driving these trends. The findings will offer insights into the trends of mobility use in the Netherlands, helping to inform future transport planning and policy decisions.\n"

    "# 2. Analysis about mobility modes\n",
    "In the Netherlands, the bicycle remains the most dominant mode of transport in the long term, exhibiting only minor fluctuations over the observed period. This stability reflects the country’s deeply embedded cycling culture, supported by extensive infrastructure. \n",
    "The use of the car showed a slight decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily as a consequence of the widespread shift to working from home. Since 2022, however, car use has gradually increased again. Overall, car dependency remains structurally stable, indicating that the private car continues to play a central role in Dutch mobility patterns despite sustainability concerns.\n",
    "The train experienced a substantial reduction in ridership during the pandemic due to the rise in remote working practices. This behavioural change appears to be structural rather than temporary. Although train use has shown signs of recovery since 2022, levels have not yet returned to those recorded before 2019. \n",
    "Similarly, bus, tram, and metro modes experienced a significant decline in passenger numbers during the pandemic. Recovery has been gradual, and usage levels remain below those of 2019. This trend suggests a broader shift away from collective modes of transport, particularly for commuting purposes.\n",
    "The share of walking increased during the pandemic, likely as a substitute for other travel modes and as a leisure activity. After 2021, walking levels decreased slightly but remained higher than before the pandemic, suggesting a modest, lasting behavioural change.\n",
    "In conclusion, the bicycle and the car continue to constitute the structurally dominant modes of transport in the Netherlands, while public transport modes are still in a phase of gradual recovery from the pandemic’s long-term effects (Mobiliteitsbeeld 2021 | Kennisinstituut Voor Mobiliteitsbeleid, 2021).\n"

    "For each mode of transportation—bike (bus/tram/metro, car, train, walking, and other) the percentage of using that mode for a trip was analyzed across provinces. Six bar plots were created to visualize and compare these differences. Since the y-axis scale varies between plots, this should be taken into account when assessing the magnitude of differences among provinces. Additionally, data on bus/tram/metro usage were unavailable for the provinces of Friesland, Overijssel, and Zeeland, and train usage data as also missing for Zeeland.\n"

    "From the plots, it can be observed that the distribution of transport mode use is relatively similar across all provinces. Cars and bicycles account for the largest shares everywhere, while 'trains', 'bus/tram/metro' (BTM), and 'other modes' consistently represent smaller proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transportation mode car use is most common in Flevoland, Drenthe, Limburg, and Zeeland, whereas provinces located in the Randstad region—such as Utrecht, North Holland, and South Holland—show higher levels of train and BTM use. A possible explanation is that residents of more rural areas tend to travel longer distances on average than those in urban areas, making them more dependent on cars and less likely to use public transport or other modes (Jorritsma, P.,2023). Interestingly, the average number of train trips per person is highest in Flevoland among all provinces. Differences in modal choice between provinces have not been extensively studied, so no specific source was available to explain this finding. However, a plausible explanation is Flevoland’s excellent accessibility by train to the north of the Netherlands, Amsterdam, and Utrecht. The Hanzelijn railway, connecting Flevoland and Zwolle, is the most important railway connection between the northern Randstad and the north of the Netherlands (Van Vulpen, N. n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other research has highlighted that the availability of transport modes and the degree of urban density strongly influence people’s mode choice (Ton,D. 2020). In high-density cities, public transport is widely available and therefore used more frequently. In medium-sized cities, the supply of public transport is more limited and consequently less utilized. In rural areas, public transport is often scarce and difficult to access, leading residents to rely more on other modes, such as the car. However, it should be noted that in this dataset, data on bus/tram/metro use are not available for the more rural provinces of Zeeland and Friesland.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bicycle use is relatively high in Groningen, Friesland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and North Holland. These provinces are urban or semi-urban, where travel distances are generally short enough to make cycling a convenient option.\n",

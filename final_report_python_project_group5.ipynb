    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "Over the last couple of years, the world has undergone a lot of changes. The beginning and ending of the COVID-19 pandemic caused tremendous impact on the public transport system and on travel behaviour in general. Furthermore, shifts in technology and societal habits have influenced why and how people move from A to B. To better understand these changes, this study examines the long-term trends in travel patterns, modal preferences, and mobility choices in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report researches how the use of different modes of transport have changed over time and if this varies in the different provinces of the Netherlands and the travel purposes. By analyzing data from the Centraal Bureau voor Statistiek, which provides detailed statistics on trips, distances, and travel times, the aim is to identify the underlying factors driving these trends. The findings will offer insights into the trends of mobility use in the Netherlands, helping to inform future transport planning and policy decisions.\n"

    "# 2. Analysis of Travel Modes\n",
    "In the Netherlands, the bicycle remains the most dominant mode of transport in the long term, exhibiting only minor fluctuations over the observed period. This stability reflects the country’s deeply embedded cycling culture, supported by extensive infrastructure. \n",
    "The use of the car showed a slight decline during the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily as a consequence of the widespread shift to working from home. Since 2022, however, car use has gradually increased again. Overall, car dependency remains structurally stable, indicating that the private car continues to play a central role in Dutch mobility patterns despite sustainability concerns.\n",
    "The train experienced a substantial reduction in ridership during the pandemic due to the rise in remote working practices (Kroesen et al., 2023). This behavioural change appears to be structural rather than temporary. Although train use has shown signs of recovery since 2022, levels have not yet returned to those recorded before 2019. \n",
    "Similarly, bus, tram, and metro modes experienced a significant decline in passenger numbers during the pandemic. Recovery has been gradual, and usage levels remain below those of 2019. This trend suggests a broader shift away from collective modes of transport, particularly for commuting purposes.\n",
    "The share of walking increased during the pandemic, likely as a substitute for other travel modes and as a leisure activity. After 2021, walking levels decreased slightly but remained higher than before the pandemic, suggesting a modest, lasting behavioural change.\n",
    "In conclusion, the bicycle and the car continue to constitute the structurally dominant modes of transport in the Netherlands, while public transport modes are still in a phase of gradual recovery from the pandemic’s long-term effects (Bakker & Moorman, 2021).\n"

Since the y-axis scale varies between plots, this should be taken into account when assessing the magnitude of differences among provinces.

    "From the plots, it can be observed that the distribution of transport mode use is relatively similar across all provinces. Cars and bicycles account for the largest shares everywhere, while 'trains', 'bus/tram/metro' (BTM), and 'other modes' consistently represent smaller proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transportation mode car use is most common in Flevoland, Drenthe, Limburg, and Zeeland, whereas provinces located in the Randstad region—such as Utrecht, North Holland, and South Holland—show higher levels of train and BTM use. A possible explanation is that residents of more rural areas tend to travel longer distances on average than those in urban areas, making them more dependent on cars and less likely to use public transport or other modes (Jorritsma et al., 2023). Interestingly, the average number of train trips per person is highest in Flevoland among all provinces. Differences in modal choice between provinces have not been extensively studied, so no specific source was available to explain this finding. However, a plausible explanation is Flevoland’s excellent accessibility by train to the north of the Netherlands, Amsterdam, and Utrecht. The Hanzelijn railway, connecting Flevoland and Zwolle, is the most important railway connection between the northern Randstad and the north of the Netherlands (Van Vulpen, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other research has highlighted that the availability of transport modes and the degree of urban density strongly influence people’s mode choice (Ton et al., 2020). In high-density cities, public transport is widely available and therefore used more frequently. In medium-sized cities, the supply of public transport is more limited and consequently less utilized. In rural areas, public transport is often scarce and difficult to access, leading residents to rely more on other modes, such as the car. However, it should be noted that in this dataset, data on bus/tram/metro use are not available for the more rural provinces of Zeeland and Friesland.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bicycle use is relatively high in Groningen, Friesland, Utrecht, Gelderland, and North Holland. These provinces are urban or semi-urban, where travel distances are generally short enough to make cycling a convenient option.\n",

    "One of the most notable trends is for the travel mode ‘Walking’ and ‘Bike’. The use for leisure/sports (green line) and touring/visiting (yellow) increased significantly during and after 2020. Especially walking with the purpose of touring has remained at a high level even after the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average number of walking trips per person per year for leisure shot up during the pandemic and has remained at a structurally high level, suggesting a lasting embrace of local, individual physical activities. Similarly, cycling for these recreational purposes has stayed robust. The walking trend for Touring/visiting, while at a lower absolute level, also shows this pattern of being maintained at a relatively high level after the initial pandemic period, indicating that people continued to prefer walking for local exploration and social visits. Cycling for Travel to/from work rebounded post-2020 but, like driving, did not fully recover to its pre-2019 levels, due to a continuing change in working culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trend is shown in the amount of trips made for work purposes. For almost all the modes, this decreased a lot during COVID-19. This is logical, since many people were not able to go to their jobs during these times and worked from home. However, after the pandemic ended, the amount of trips for work increased but did not go back to their original state. This is mainly because the culture surrounding work has permanently shifted. The trend in the graphs is reflecting the adoption of more hybrid work environments where people work partly from home, partly on-site.\n",
    "The widespread adoption of remote work has evolved into a lasting acceptance of employees splitting their time between the office and home. What was once a temporary necessity has now become a standard practice for many companies. As a result, the traditional five-day commute is no longer the norm, leading to a structurally lower number of work-related trips even after all restrictions were lifted (Breukelen, 2021). The graphs clearly illustrate this \"new normal\" for commuting."

    "# 5. Conclusion \n",
    "This research analyzed long-term trends in travel behavior in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023, revealing significant structural changes in mobility patterns largely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and evolving work practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Travel Mode Evolution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bicycle and car remain the dominant modes of transport in the Netherlands, demonstrating remarkable resilience throughout the study period. While bicycle use showed only minor fluctuations, maintaining its position as the most popular transport mode, car usage experienced a temporary decline during the pandemic but has since recovered to near pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, public transport modes (train, bus, tram, and metro) suffered substantial ridership losses during COVID-19 and have shown only gradual recovery, indicating a potential structural shift away from collective transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regional Variations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear geographical patterns emerge in transport preferences across Dutch provinces. Rural provinces such as Flevoland, Drenthe, Limburg, and Zeeland show higher car dependency, while Randstad provinces (Utrecht, North Holland, South Holland) demonstrate greater reliance on public transport and cycling. These differences reflect the influence of urban density, infrastructure availability, and travel distance requirements on modal choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Travel Purpose Transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most pronounced changes occurred in work-related travel patterns. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of remote and hybrid working arrangements, resulting in a permanent reduction in commuting trips across all transport modes. Conversely, leisure and recreational travel, particularly walking and cycling for sports and touring purposes, increased significantly and remained elevated even after pandemic restrictions ended, suggesting a lasting shift toward local, individual mobility activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings indicate that the Netherlands is experiencing a \"new normal\" in mobility characterized by reduced commuting, sustained recreational travel, and a gradual recovery of public transport. These structural changes have important implications for transport planning, infrastructure investment, and sustainability policies. The resilience of cycling and the partial shift toward local mobility present opportunities for sustainable transport development, while the challenges facing public transport recovery require targeted policy interventions."
